# My Website

## Description:
This is a simple, responsive website with three pages: Home, About, and Contact. It follows modern design principles like minimalism and flat design.

## Features:
- Responsive layout for all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Form validation for the contact page.
- Interactive navigation with hover effects.

## Design Choices:
I chose a minimalistic design with a blue accent color to keep the user experience clean and focused. The layout is simple and easy to navigate, with clear call-to-action buttons.

## JavaScript Features:
- Form validation on the contact page to ensure all fields are filled out before submission.
- Smooth transitions for hover effects.

## Challenges:
One challenge was ensuring the site looked good on various screen sizes. To solve this, I used media queries and tested on different devices.

## Deployment:
The website was deployed using GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to run it locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
